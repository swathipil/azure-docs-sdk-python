summary: 'A JSON encoder that''s capable of serializing datetime objects and bytes.


  Constructor for JSONEncoder, with sensible defaults.


  If skipkeys is false, then it is a TypeError to attempt

  encoding of keys that are not str, int, float or None.  If

  skipkeys is True, such items are simply skipped.


  If ensure_ascii is true, the output is guaranteed to be str

  objects with all incoming non-ASCII characters escaped.  If

  ensure_ascii is false, the output can contain non-ASCII characters.


  If check_circular is true, then lists, dicts, and custom encoded

  objects will be checked for circular references during encoding to

  prevent an infinite recursion (which would cause an RecursionError).

  Otherwise, no such check takes place.


  If allow_nan is true, then NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity will be

  encoded as such.  This behavior is not JSON specification compliant,

  but is consistent with most JavaScript based encoders and decoders.

  Otherwise, it will be a ValueError to encode such floats.


  If sort_keys is true, then the output of dictionaries will be

  sorted by key; this is useful for regression tests to ensure

  that JSON serializations can be compared on a day-to-day basis.


  If indent is a non-negative integer, then JSON array

  elements and object members will be pretty-printed with that

  indent level.  An indent level of 0 will only insert newlines.

  None is the most compact representation.


  If specified, separators should be an (item_separator, key_separator)

  tuple.  The default is ('', '', '': '') if *indent* is `None` and

  ('','', '': '') otherwise.  To get the most compact JSON representation,

  you should specify ('','', '':'') to eliminate whitespace.


  If specified, default is a function that gets called for objects

  that can''t otherwise be serialized.  It should return a JSON encodable

  version of the object or raise a `TypeError`.'
